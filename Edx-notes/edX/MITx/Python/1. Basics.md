## Intro

Alexandria of Heron recipe for deducing square root of number x 

1) Start with a guess, g
2) If g*g is close enough to x, stop and say g is the
answer
3) Otherwise make a new guess by averaging g and x/g
4) Using the new guess, repeat process until close enough

**BASIC PRIMITIVES**

- Turing showed you can compute anything using 6 primitives: - And those are move left, move right, scan, read, write, do nothing.

- **Turing Complete**: Anything computable in one language is computable in any other programming language

- Can abstract methods to create new primitives


## Programming Language = Primitives+Expressions(legal comb'n of primitives)+Abstraction

Primitives consist of numbers+strings+simple operators

Legal Primitives and Expressions have values and meanings associated with them.

**Aspects of languages**

- Syntax
- Static semantics (syntactically valid and meaningful). 5+"h" valid syntax but static semantically wrong.
- Semantics: Meaning associated with a legal expression: a static semantically correct expression will only have one meaning.


## Types

**Objects**: Fundamental primitive representing data
- Scalar
- Non-scalar
Objects have type associated with them->determines what kind of operations can be performed on them.

**Scalar objects**: int, float, bool, NoneType

Expression syntax:
<code>\<object><operator(like add, sub etc)>\<object></code>

- round() rounds to the nearest int while int truncates the float part
- range(a,b,c) lists all the the numbers from a to b, excluding b and c as the step (the next cth element in the list) 
- strings are immutable i.e cant be modified directly. s="abc", s[0]='v' is invalid
