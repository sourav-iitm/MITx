## Sample Space

- Set of all possible outcomes, the list must be:
	- mutually exclusive
	- collectively exhaustive
	- at the right granularity

Discrete and continuous sample spaces

## Event

subset A of a sample space S, probability is assigned to events

## Probability Axioms

- Non-negative: P(A)>=0
- Normalisation: P(S)=1
- If  $$
A \cap B=\phi
$$ then $$
P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B)
$$

## Some Properties of Probability Laws

Consider a probability law, and let

A, B, and C be events.

(a) $$If A ⊂ B, then P(A) ≤ P(B)$$

(b) $$P(A∪B) =P(A) +P(B)−P(A∩B)$$

(c) $$P(A∪B)≤P(A) +P(B)$$
(d) $$P(A∪B∪C) = P(A) +P(A^c∩B) +P(A^{c}∩B^{c}∩C)$$

## Discrete Probability Law

Sample space S such that
$$
S=\{s_{1}, s_{2}, \dots{}, s_{n}\}
$$
then, 

$$
P(S)=P(s_{1})+P(s_{2}) \dots{}+P(s_{n})
$$


## Discrete uniform Probability Law:

Let sample space S consists of n elements, A is any event in S
then,
$$
P(A)= \frac{\text{ Number of elements in A}}{n}
$$


## Consequences of the axioms

- $$
P(A)\leq 1
$$
- $$
P(\phi)=0
$$
- $$
P(A\cup B\cup C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)
$$
- $$
\\If { \space A \subset B \space then \ P(A)\leq B}
$$
- $$
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)
$$
